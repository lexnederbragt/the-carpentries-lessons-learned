## Does it work?
The uptake of new techniques is evident and we are creating a more skilled research community - 
geographically and across domains. We are seeing the impact on the speed, process and practices of 
organising workshops, with more institutions hosting the training and streamlining it 
into official post-graduate and undergraduate academic curricula at research institutions, 
more training courses being developed for more domains and tools, 
better instructor conversion and retention rates and increased collaboration with government and private sectors.
(Now we have to justify below all the above claims.)

### Community and impact is growing 
- More institutions and countries (use assessment data)
- More instructors, better instructor conversion and retention rates (use assessment data)
- Becoming an internationally recognised brand and having an impact beyond the Carpentries

### People are retaining the skills we teach
- Digital competency is growing (use assessment data and testimonials to show)
- People are retaining and using skills we teach (use assessment data and testimonials to show)
- Uptake of new tools and skills that we pick up by being part of the community not just what we teach at workshops (anecdotally)

### Sharing and reusing the methodology and resources
- Reusing the Carpentries resources (lessons, lesson templates, workshop templates, etc.)
- Reusing pedagogical skills we teach in other course and teaching they do (anecdotally)
- New training courses are being developed (metrics from the Incubator), and new skills/tools are being picked up

### Working with others
- Collaboration with other communities and institutions, feeding off each other and helping each other grow (international RSE community, the UK’s Software Sustainability Institute, CodeRefinery, Dutch eScience Centre, ... )
- Building on top of the Carpentries' foundational courses and not reinventing the wheel
